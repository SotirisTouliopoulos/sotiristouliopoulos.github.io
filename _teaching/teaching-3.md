From counts to volcano plots & machine learning!

Differential expression analysis is widely used by bioinformaticians to identify alterations
in gene expression, under different conditions. Students had the chance to hands-on analyze 
microarray data and examine possible outcomes when applying different parameters. 
Volcano plots, cluster heatmaps & machine learning helped students find the most affected genes and pathways 
and propose the ideal drug treatment.

This workshop was presented at the [2nd Panhellenic Conference of Students Bioscientists](https://www.pfsb.gr/2pfsb/)
