From structure examination to mutations and publication-ready figures!

PyMOL is a commonly used software in the field of structural biology.
Students got hands-on experience in analyzing protein structures.
They highlighted specific secondary structure elements, counted inter-atom distances,
mutated aminoacids and created publication-ready figures.

This workshop was presented at the [2nd Panhellenic Conference of Students Bioscientists](https://www.pfsb.gr/2pfsb/)
