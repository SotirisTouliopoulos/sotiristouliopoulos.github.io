From molecular parts to genetics circuits & logic gates!

This workshop served as an introduction to the field of modeling in synthetic biology.
Students used software to design genetic circuits and modeled their expected behaviour.
We showed how factors such as positive/negative regulation, plasmid copy number,
mRNA and protein degradation can affect gene regulation and a protein's/metabolite's abundance.

This workshop was presented at the [1st Panhellenic Conference of Students Bioscientists](https://www.pfsb.gr/1pfsb/)
