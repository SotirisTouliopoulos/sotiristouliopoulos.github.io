This research article is [published](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmgm.2025.109228) in the Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling. It explores the structural and functional implications of atomic density distributions in proteins!

Key Highlights:
- Atomic density profiles were calculated for 21,255 non-redundant protein structures.
- Analysis of the profiles indicated the presence of statistically significant differences.
- Structural and functional classification revealed patterns related to the evolutionary history of the proteins.
