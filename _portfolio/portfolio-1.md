An open-source software development internship!


Over the summer, I had the opportunity to contribute to dingo, a Python package for metabolic networks analysis. 
My focus was on expanding the package by implementing features for metabolic models reduction and pathways prediction, among others.


If you're interested in learning more about my project, you can read the 
[blog](https://sotiristouliopoulos.github.io/dingo/) I created for my final evaluation.
