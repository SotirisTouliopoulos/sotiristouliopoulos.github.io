During the summer of 2024 I worked as a contributor to dingo,
a python package that analyzes metabolic networks.
I expanded dingo by incorporating pre- and post-sampling features.
You can take a look at the [blog](https://sotiristouliopoulos.github.io/dingo/) 
created for the evaluation of my contribution.
